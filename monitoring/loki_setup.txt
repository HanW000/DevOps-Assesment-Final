Grafana Loki Setup (Local)

1. How Loki was started

Loki was started locally using Docker with the official Grafana Loki image:

docker run -d \
  --name loki \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  grafana/loki:2.9.0 \
  -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml

This starts Loki in standalone mode using the built-in local configuration,
which is suitable for development and testing.

2. Log source

Application logs are generated by Docker containers (hello.py) and Nomad jobs.
In a real deployment, tools such as Promtail or Nomad's logging integration
would forward container logs to Loki.

For this assessment, Docker container logs are used as the log source.

3. How logs were viewed

Logs can be viewed using standard Docker and Nomad commands:

- View Docker container logs:
  docker logs <container_id>

- View Nomad allocation logs:
  nomad alloc logs <alloc_id>

Loki serves as the centralized log aggregation backend, while logs are verified
locally through container and Nomad log outputs.
